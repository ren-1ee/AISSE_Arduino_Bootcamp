  Learning Intention:
  The students will learn how to wire a pull-up and pull-down switch and configure PINs for
  digital input and read binary data from those PINs.
 
  Success Criteria:
    1.  I understand how to configure a PIN for input and output
    2.  I know how to read binary data from a specific PIN
    3.  I know how to write binary data to a specific PIN
    4.  I understand that LOW = false = 0 = <1.5 volts (or Off) and that
        HIGH = true = 1 = >3 volts (or On)
    5.  I can wire a LED for digital output in TINKERCAD
    6.  I can wire a switch for digital input in TINKERCAD
    7.  I know the difference between a switch and a momentary switch
    8.  I can organise output data so it correctly plots on the serial monitor
    9.  I can apply this knowledge to the Button and the Line Finder in the sensor kit

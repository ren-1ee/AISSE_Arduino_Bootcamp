  Learning Intention: The students will understand the difference between the inbuilt setup and loop methods, and understand the basics of the serial monitor'.
  Success Criteria:
	1. I understand the different behaviours of the setup and loop methods
	2. I can print information to the serial monitor
	3. I can print information to a new line of the serial monitor
	4. I can access the serial plotter to see data output over time
	5. I understand the impact of having more than one setup or loop methods in my sketch
  
  Student Notes: 
    'Serial.println' will print text then add a paragraph key.
    Arduino is case-sensitve.
    Make sure 'No Line Ending' is set for now.

// The setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Serial monitor is configured to 9600br.");
}

// The loop function runs over and over again forever
void loop() {
  while(!Serial.available());
  String Jeff = Serial.readString();
  Serial.println(Jeff);
}
